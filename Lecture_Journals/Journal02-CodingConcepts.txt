Hi Everybody!

Today we started getting into the nitty gritty of coding concepts, and on Friday we'll have an intro lab to get more acquainted with Matlab! For today's journal prompt, I want to get you all thinking about how to write an algorithm, and how specific you usually need to be when "speaking" with the computer.

Congratulations! It's the future! 
We now have robots to do all our tasks for us, but unfortunately your PBJ-9000 forgot how to do it's only task, making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches! PBJ-9000 only understands a few commands and items, so please use them to remind PBJ-9000 how to fulfill its raison d'Ãªtre and make your sandwich!

COMMANDS
Cut {item} using {item} in {direction} direction
Flip {item} in {direction} direction
Place {item} on {item}
Scoop {item} with {item}
Spread {item} from {item} onto {item}

ITEMS

Bread 2

Peanut Butter

Just remember, PBJ-9000 will do *only* and *exactly* what you tell it to do, in the order you tell it to be done.
